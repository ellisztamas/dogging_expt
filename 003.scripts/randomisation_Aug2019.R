#' Tom Ellis, 31st July 2019
#' Script to randomise plants for the field experiment in SÃ¥ltea, to be set up
#' summer 2019. There are two separate cohorts to be sown into trays of 6x11 wells:
#' 1. Ten accessions of natural lines from the 1001 genomes collection. 9 trays
#'    with each accession plus an emplty well in each column.
#' 2. Ten F1 familes (5 crosses in each direction) plus parental lines. 6 trays.
#'    Each cross or parent is randomised within 2 columns of each tray, with two
#'    empty wells.
